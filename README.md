This repository contains a prototype implementation of a deterministic, GPU-resident scheduler, inspired by architectural ideas from modern ML inference pipelines, but applied to a general-purpose scheduling workload.
The project demonstrates how a CPU-style branchy/loopy/pointer-heavy program can be expressed in a GPU-friendly “program-as-weights” format, enabling high parallelism
